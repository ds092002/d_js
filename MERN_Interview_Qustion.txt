Here are comprehensive **interview questions and answers** for a **MERN Stack Developer with 1 year of experience**, covering all your requested categories:



## ✅ General MERN Stack Questions

### 1. **What is the MERN stack? How do the technologies work together?**

**Answer:**
MERN stands for **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**.

* **MongoDB**: NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
* **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js that handles routing and APIs.
* **React.js**: Frontend library used for building user interfaces.
* **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building the backend server.

Together, they form a full-stack JavaScript application — data flows from React (frontend) → Express + Node (backend) → MongoDB (database).



### 2. **Describe the flow of data from the front end to the back end in a MERN application.**

**Answer:**

1. **React** sends HTTP requests (using `fetch` or `axios`) to the backend.
2. **Express.js** receives the request and passes it to the appropriate route.
3. The backend logic interacts with **MongoDB** using **Mongoose** to read/write data.
4. The backend sends a response back to the React frontend.



### 3. **What is the difference between relational and non-relational databases?**

**Answer:**

* **Relational** databases (e.g., MySQL) use tables and schemas with relationships using foreign keys.
* **Non-relational** databases (e.g., MongoDB) use collections and documents, offering more flexibility and scalability for unstructured data.



## 🟢 MongoDB

### 4. **What is MongoDB? How is it different from SQL databases?**

**Answer:**
MongoDB is a **NoSQL** database that stores data as **JSON-like documents**.
Differences:

* No fixed schema (flexible structure)
* Uses collections and documents instead of tables and rows
* Better for large-scale, unstructured, or hierarchical data.



### 5. **What is a document in MongoDB?**

**Answer:**
A document is a **single record** in MongoDB, stored in **BSON format** (binary JSON). It can contain nested fields and arrays.

Example:

```json
{
  "_id": "123",
  "name": "John",
  "skills": ["React", "Node"]
}
```



### 6. **How do you perform CRUD operations in MongoDB using Mongoose?**

**Answer:**

```js
// Create
const user = new User({ name: 'John', age: 25 });
await user.save();

// Read
const users = await User.find();

// Update
await User.findByIdAndUpdate(id, { name: 'Doe' });

// Delete
await User.findByIdAndDelete(id);
```



### 7. **What is a schema in Mongoose? How do you define relationships between documents?**

**Answer:**
A schema defines the **structure** and **data types** for documents in a collection.

Example:

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  posts: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Post' }]
});
```

You define relationships using **ObjectId** and `ref`.



### 8. **How do you handle validation in Mongoose?**

**Answer:**
Use schema-level validators:

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  age: { type: Number, min: 18 }
});
```

You can also use `.validate()` and custom validation functions.
 


## ⚪ Express.js

### 9. **What is Express.js and why is it used?**

**Answer:**
Express.js is a **web framework for Node.js** used to build APIs and web applications. It simplifies routing, middleware, and request/response handling.



### 10. **How do you create a simple API using Express?**

**Answer:**

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('User list');
});

app.listen(5000);
```



### 11. **What are middleware functions in Express? Give examples.**

**Answer:**
Middleware are functions that run before the final request handler. They can modify `req`, `res`, or terminate the request.

Example:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received');
  next();
});
```



### 12. **How do you handle errors in Express?**

**Answer:**

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.message);
  res.status(500).send('Server error');
});
```



### 13. **How do you protect routes using middleware?**

**Answer:**
Use JWT-based middleware:

```js
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization');
  if (!token) return res.status(401).send('Access Denied');
  try {
    const verified = jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
    req.user = verified;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid Token');
  }
};
```


✅ React – Basic Definition
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture and relies on a virtual DOM for fast rendering.

✅ Angular – Basic Definition
Angular is a TypeScript-based framework developed by Google for building full-featured web applications. It includes built-in tools like routing, HTTP client, forms, and uses real DOM with two-way data binding.


## 🔵 React.js

### 14. **What is the virtual DOM and how does React use it?**

**Answer:**
The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM.
React uses it to **efficiently update the UI** by comparing changes and applying only the necessary updates (diffing algorithm).



### 15. **What are functional components and class components?**

**Answer:**

* **Functional components** are JavaScript functions with hooks.
* **Class components** use ES6 classes and lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount()`.



### 16. **Explain the difference between `useState` and `useEffect`.**

**Answer:**

* `useState` is used to **store state** inside functional components.
* `useEffect` is used to **perform side effects** like fetching data or setting timers.



### 17. **How does lifting state up work in React?**

**Answer:**
Lifting state up means moving state to the **common parent component** so that multiple child components can share and update it.



### 18. **How do you handle form submission in React?**

**Answer:**

```js
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log(formData);
};

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
</form>
```



## 🟤 Node.js

### 19. **What is Node.js and how does it work?**

**Answer:**
Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime** that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. It uses an **event-driven**, **non-blocking I/O model** for scalable network applications.



### 20. **What are the core modules in Node.js?**

**Answer:**
Common core modules:

* `fs` (file system)
* `http` (HTTP server)
* `path` (file paths)
* `events` (event emitter)
* `os` (system info)



### 21. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in Node?**

**Answer:**

* **Synchronous**: Blocks the execution (e.g., `fs.readFileSync`)
* **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking, uses callbacks/promises (e.g., `fs.readFile`)



### 22. **How does the event loop work in Node.js?**

**Answer:**
The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and callback queue. It executes callbacks from the queue when the stack is clear, allowing **asynchronous operations**.



### 23. **How do you handle file uploads in Node.js?**

**Answer:**
Using `multer` middleware:

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded');
});
```



## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### 24. **How do you implement authentication in MERN stack? (JWT, bcrypt)**

**Answer:**

* Hash passwords using **bcrypt** during registration.
* On login, compare password and issue **JWT token**.
* Use a middleware to protect private routes by verifying the JWT.



### 25. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**

**Answer:**

* **Authentication**: Verifying identity (e.g., login)
* **Authorization**: Checking permissions (e.g., isAdmin)



### 26. **How do you store and verify passwords securely?**

**Answer:**

```js
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, storedHash);
```



### 27. **What are common security issues in MERN apps and how do you prevent them?**

**Answer:**

* **XSS**: Sanitize user input
* **CSRF**: Use CSRF tokens
* **SQL/NoSQL Injection**: Use ORM (Mongoose), parameterized queries
* **JWT Theft**: Use `HttpOnly` cookies or short expiry tokens



## 🌐 API & Integration

### 28. **What is REST API? How do you create one using Express?**

**Answer:**
A REST API uses **HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)** to interact with data.

Example:

```js
app.get('/users', (req, res) => res.json(users));
```



### 29. **How do you connect React frontend with Express backend?**

## 🔁 Intermediate MERN Stack Questions

### 1. **What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?**

**Answer**:

* **Controlled components** have their state managed by React (using `useState`).
* **Uncontrolled components** rely on the DOM to manage form state using `ref`.

```jsx
// Controlled
<input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />

// Uncontrolled
<input ref={inputRef} />
```



### 2. **What is the purpose of `useEffect` hook in React?**

**Answer**:
`useEffect` is used to run side effects like fetching data, updating the DOM, setting up subscriptions, etc.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []); // Empty array means it runs once on mount
```



### 3. **How do you manage global state in a MERN app?**

**Answer**:

* You can use **Context API**, **Redux**, or **Zustand** for global state management.
* Redux is often used for larger apps to keep state consistent across components.



### 4. **What is `populate` in Mongoose?**

**Answer**:
`populate()` is used to join documents across collections. For example, getting user details from a post:

```js
Post.find().populate('user_id').exec();
```



### 5. **What is middleware in Express?**

**Answer**:
Middleware functions have access to `req`, `res`, and `next()`. They’re used for authentication, logging, body parsing, etc.

```js
app.use(express.json()); // built-in middleware
```

Custom middleware example:

```js
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers.token) return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  next();
};
```



### 6. **What is CORS and how do you handle it in Express?**

**Answer**:
**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restricts requests between different domains.

To enable CORS:

```js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```



### 7. **What is `process.env` in Node.js?**

**Answer**:
It allows access to environment variables. Used to manage secrets like database URLs, JWT secrets, etc.

```js
const dbUrl = process.env.MONGO_URI;
```



### 8. **What is the difference between PUT and PATCH in REST API?**

**Answer**:

* **PUT** replaces the whole resource.
* **PATCH** updates part of the resource.



### 9. **How do you upload a file in Node.js using Multer?**

**Answer**:

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded');
});
```



### 10. **How do you handle errors globally in Express?**

**Answer**:

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({ message: err.message });
});
```



### 11. **What is debouncing and throttling in React?**

**Answer**:

* **Debouncing**: Waits until the user stops typing before running a function.
* **Throttling**: Limits a function to run once in a specified time.

Useful in search inputs or resize events.



### 12. **What is `async/await` in Node.js?**

**Answer**:
Syntactic sugar over Promises to write cleaner asynchronous code.

```js
const data = await fetchData();
```



### 13. **What is `res.json()` vs `res.send()` in Express?**

**Answer**:

* `res.send()` sends any type of response.
* `res.json()` is specifically for sending JSON data.



### 14. **What is component reusability in React?**

**Answer**:
Breaking UI into reusable components helps maintain cleaner code and DRY principles.
Example: A `Button` component used in multiple places with different props.



### 15. **How do you protect routes in React (Frontend)?**

**Answer**:
Use **Protected Routes** by checking auth token or login state.

```jsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" />} />
```

| Mutable   | Yes              | No                               |
| Ownership | Inside component | Passed from parent               |
| Use       | Internal changes | Communication between components |



### ✅ **Intermediate Questions**

**9. What is conditional rendering in React?**
It means showing or hiding UI elements based on conditions using `if`, `ternary`, or `&&`.



**10. What is "lifting state up"?**
Moving state to a common parent component so that sibling components can share or modify it.



**11. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?**

* **Controlled**: Form input is controlled by React state.
* **Uncontrolled**: Form input is handled by the DOM using `ref`.



**12. What is the purpose of `key` in lists?**
`key` helps React identify which items changed, are added, or removed in lists.

```js
items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
```



**13. What is `ref` and why is it used?**
`ref` provides a way to directly access a DOM element or React element.
Useful for focus control, animations, and reading values.



### ✅ **Advanced Questions (for 1-year level)**

**14. What is React Context API?**
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.



**15. What is React Router and why is it used?**
React Router is used for navigation in single-page applications. It maps URLs to components.

```js
<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
```
